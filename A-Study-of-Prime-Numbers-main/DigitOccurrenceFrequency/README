Console Program in C++

Included within this folder:

main.cpp
  the console application
  
improved main.cpp
  slightly reworked main.cpp which is about 68% faster (tested both on the first 3 million pos integers)
 
images of results running the program through the first million positive integers
  (sorry about the poorly thoughtout screenshots with literally no titles or ledgends)



I may revisit this program later on and refine the searching algorithm, 
as currently the program is searching through all values up to the desired number which is oviously inefficient

Next step would be to impliment within the algorithm, to ignore all values which include 2,4,6,8,0 as the placevalue last digit 
(instead of asking program to compute whether the number is even, as that would be another waste of memory)
(and 5 when there exists more than 1 digit in the number)
